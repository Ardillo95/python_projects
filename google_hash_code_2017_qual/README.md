Google Hash Code 2017.

This is my first solution (almost the same, I have commented the code but it is worth the same points: 1319734), summited at 21:18 (2 hours and 30 minutes after the competition started).

For some circumstances I made all by my own, it is not the best solution but it is not bad.

All the input files must be on the same folder as videos.py and in order to execute the program: python3 videos.py
